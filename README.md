I created this application to quickly produce and save SQL scripts for my company's clients to help them efficiently produce custom reports of their database.  The program can join up to two tables and can filter records using SQL WHERE filters, >, <, =, NOT, LIKE, IN, and LINK.  The user is meant to select records, select filters, and then press "copy", which copies the SQL script to the clipboard.  They would then paste the script into their SQL software to produce the desired data set.
